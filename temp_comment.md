### Grooming Notice

This issue has been reviewed as part of the GROOMER sweep.

**Analysis:**
This issue is exceptionally well-defined and comprehensive. It provides a clear vision for the 'insert coin' feature, detailed implementation concepts, and thorough acceptance criteria. It serves as an excellent blueprint for development.

**Affected Code & Approaches:**
The issue body already outlines the primary affected areas (`assets/terminal.js` for command handling) and conceptual code for Stripe integration. A key consideration for secure Stripe payments will be the necessary **backend API integration** to handle payment processing, webhooks, and secure key management. This will likely involve new API routes and server-side logic.

**Status:**
- Title: Clear and actionable.
- Labels: Normalized (`enhancement`, `priority: medium`).
- Linked Tasks: N/A.
- Staleness: Active and well-defined.

**Next Steps:**
This issue is ready for development. The implementation should prioritize the secure backend integration for Stripe payments before building out the frontend UI and feature gating.
