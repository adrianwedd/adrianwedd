# Test Coverage Report

## Infrastructure Setup

✅ **Coverage Infrastructure Established**
- **Tool**: Jest with built-in coverage reporting
- **Configuration**: `.c8rc.json` and `jest.config.js`
- **Target**: 80% coverage across all metrics
- **Reports**: Text, HTML, LCOV, JSON summary formats

## Current Baseline Coverage

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Total Files**: 14 JavaScript modules  
**Test Coverage**: 0% (baseline measurement)

## Coverage Goals

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
- [x] Jest and coverage tooling installed
- [x] Configuration files created
- [x] Package.json scripts configured
- [x] Baseline measurement established

### Phase 2: Core Module Testing (🚧 In Progress)
- [ ] Terminal.js core functionality (>90% target)
- [ ] GitHubTaskManager class (>95% target)
- [ ] AI service integration (>85% target)
- [ ] System monitor functionality (>80% target)

### Phase 3: Feature Testing (📝 Planned)
- [ ] Voice interface functionality (>80% target)
- [ ] Music player and audio visualization (>75% target)
- [ ] Theme system and visual effects (>85% target)
- [ ] Command history and autocomplete (>85% target)

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (📝 Planned)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow coverage
- [ ] API integration testing
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases (>90% target)
- [ ] Performance and load testing

## Testing Scripts

```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:unit

# Generate HTML coverage report
npm run coverage:html

# Check coverage thresholds
npm run coverage:check

# Run all tests (unit + e2e)
npm test
```

## Coverage Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- **Environment**: jsdom for DOM testing
- **Coverage Directory**: `./coverage`
- **Reporters**: text, html, lcov, json-summary
- **Thresholds**: 80% for all metrics (currently disabled for baseline)

### C8 Configuration (`.c8rc.json`)
- **Include**: `assets/**/*.js`
- **Exclude**: tests, node_modules, coverage, dist
- **Watermarks**: 80-90% coverage levels
- **Check Coverage**: Enabled with 80% thresholds

## Next Steps

1. **Implement core module tests** (terminal.js, github-task-manager.js)
2. **Enable coverage thresholds** once baseline tests are in place
3. **Add CI/CD integration** for automated coverage reporting
4. **Create coverage badges** for README display
5. **Set up coverage trend tracking** for continuous improvement
