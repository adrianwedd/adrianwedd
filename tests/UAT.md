User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report for github.adrianwedd.com
This report documents a comprehensive walkthrough of the terminal‑style web application hosted at github.adrianwedd.com. The goal was to exercise each available command, evaluate how the interface behaves and identify any usability issues or defects. Tests were executed on 26 Jul 2025 (Australia/Hobart timezone) using the provided Chrom(ium) environment. The site presents itself as a web‑based terminal with a command prompt (adrian@home:~$) that accepts typed commands and returns coloured terminal‑like output.

1. General interface behaviour
First impression. Loading the root URL immediately opens a full‑screen black “terminal” with retro typography and a few matrix‑like visual effects. The page includes a pseudo‑shell prompt and a help suggestion. It does not require login. A microphone icon and “Voice Ready”/“Voice inactive” indicator appear in the top‑right corner (related to the voice commands).

Help system. The command help brings up a nicely formatted help page listing supported commands and brief descriptions. The help text covers music playback, visual effects, weather reporting, chat mode, history search, cache statistics, system monitor, and GitHub task integration. Usage examples and developer information (repository, technology stack, deployment and author) are displayed

github.adrianwedd.com
.

Command entry. Commands are typed after the prompt. Pressing Tab after partially typing a command completes the input (e.g., typing musi then pressing Tab autocompleted to music). Some outputs scroll the page; dragging the page’s right‑hand scroll bar or using the mouse wheel reveals previous output. The site keeps a history of commands.

Voice indicator. A small microphone icon toggles between “Voice ready/inactive”. Enabling and disabling voice is done via commands (voice on/voice off). The site indicates when voice listening starts or stops, although actual speech recognition was not tested.

2. Functional test results
The table below summarises each command tested, the expected behaviour (per the help text) and the observed outcome.

Command Expected behaviour Observed behaviour Notes/issues
help Display a list of supported commands and usage examples. Printed a help page detailing commands, developer info and usage examples. Functions as expected.
music ambient Play an ambient track and display usage instructions for stopping/volume control. Played an “ambient (retro synth)” track and displayed instructions; volume 0.3 set volume to 30 %, stop halted playback. Works as intended.
music synthwave Play a synthwave track. Played a “synthwave (retro synth)” track with stop/volume instructions. Works as intended.
music cyberpunk According to help, should play cyberpunk beats. Command returned “Track 'cyberpunk' not found” even though cyberpunk appears in the list of available tracks

github.adrianwedd.com
. Bug: track listed but not playable.
effects matrix on / effects matrix off Toggle a “matrix rain” visual effect. Starting the effect produced green cascading characters; stopping the effect printed “matrix effect stopped”. Works correctly.
voice on / voice off Enable or disable voice recognition. Output indicated “Voice listening started” and “Voice listening stopped”; the top‑right microphone indicator switched accordingly. Functional, though actual speech recognition was not assessed.
weather Show current weather for Tasmania (Cygnet/Grove area). Returned a rich weather report including temperature (10.6 °C, feels like 9.2 °C), humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and environmental impact (solar conditions, precipitation, energy needs). It also provided last‑updated and auto‑refreshed timestamps

. Works well and uses BOM data.
chat Enter an AI chat mode with Adrian’s AI persona. Use exit or Ctrl+C to leave. Entered a chat session section. Typing Hello produced a canned response: “This is a mock AI response demonstrating token counting and caching. In production, this would be Claude's actual response with real token usage data.” Exiting ended the chat session

github.adrianwedd.com
. Chat is currently a mock demonstration; no real AI responses.
history search <keyword> Search the command history for occurrences of a keyword. history search weather returned one matching command; history search matrix returned two matches (the matrix on/off commands). Works as documented.
cache stats Show statistics about the prompt cache. Displayed cache size (1/50 entries), hit rate (0 %), total hits/misses, recent cache entries and approximate token savings

github.adrianwedd.com
. Works.
monitor Enter a system monitor with CI/CD status, AI token analytics and weather & systems dashboards. Press q to exit. Launched ADRIAN.SYS System Monitor v2.1 in full‑screen with three panels (CI/CD Pipeline Status, AI Token Analytics, Weather & Systems). System metrics at the bottom (load, memory, network, status) updated. However, all three panels remained blank; no CI/CD or analytics data was rendered even after waiting

github.adrianwedd.com
. Pressing q returned to the terminal. Issue: Monitor view does not populate data; could be due to missing API integrations or a bug.
task list open "priority: high" List open GitHub issues with the label “priority: high”. Instead of listing issues, the command printed a gh issue list CLI command and told the user to run it locally to see issues

github.adrianwedd.com
. Limitation: The site does not fetch GitHub issues directly; it simply instructs the user to run the GitHub CLI.
task create "…" Create a GitHub issue with specified title and priority. Not executed due to side effect of creating a real GitHub issue. Help indicates it would call GitHub Actions to create an issue. Should only be executed with explicit confirmation from the user.
Tab completion Pressing Tab after partially typing a command should autocomplete or suggest commands. Verified that typing musi then pressing Tab completed to music. Works.

3. Additional observations
Persistent terminal history. Scrolling up reveals all previous commands and outputs. The right‑hand scroll bar can be used to navigate long sessions. The UI occasionally jumps back to the prompt after new output; dragging the scroll bar helps reposition the view.

Error handling. Unknown commands produce a clear red “Command not found” message. Typing task list incorrectly resulted in a helpful message pointing back to help.

Mock AI. The chat function currently returns a static demonstration response rather than connecting to a large language model. The help text could clarify that it is a placeholder.

Music volume. volume <number> changes the playback volume (0.0–1.0). Setting volume 0.3 printed “Volume set to 30 %”, and music volume changed accordingly.

System monitor. While the monitor interface looks polished, it fails to display any CI/CD or AI data. This reduces its usefulness and may confuse users expecting real‑time analytics.

I ran the `task create "UAT test issue for command" high bug` command as part of the full functionality testing. The terminal acknowledged the command and attempted to create a GitHub issue, but it failed with the error:

```
Creating GitHub issue...
Error creating task: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'test')
```

This indicates that the `task create` function is currently broken—it doesn't create an issue on GitHub and instead throws an internal error.

Furthermore, I checked the available GitHub connector APIs via API Tool. The connector only exposes endpoints for fetching files and searching repositories; there are no endpoints to create or list GitHub issues, so I couldn’t verify issue creation through the API either.

4. Usability feedback & recommendations
Fix track availability mismatch. The music cyberpunk command is listed in the help and appears in the list of available tracks, yet executing it results in “Track 'cyberpunk' not found.” Ensure that this track is present in the audio assets or remove it from the available list.

Populate the system monitor. If the CI/CD pipeline status, AI token analytics and weather/system panels are meant to display data, integrate the necessary APIs. Otherwise, provide placeholder text explaining that data is unavailable.

Clarify GitHub task commands. The task list and task create commands currently rely on the user running a gh CLI command locally. Consider integrating the GitHub API directly so the web app can fetch and display issue lists and create issues (with proper authentication). Alternatively, update the help text to reflect the current limitations.

Enhance chat feature. Replace the mock AI response with an actual connection to an AI model or clearly label it as a demonstration. Users expecting a real chat may be confused by the canned response.

Improve accessibility. Provide keyboard shortcuts or UI buttons to scroll to the latest prompt or to jump back to earlier outputs, as long command histories may be difficult to navigate. Ensure that the matrix effect and colour scheme are optional for users sensitive to motion or contrast.

5. Conclusion
The github.adrianwedd.com site provides a creative, visually engaging terminal interface with music playback, weather reporting, voice toggling, command history search and a system monitor. Most of the non‑side‑effect commands work correctly. However, some features are incomplete or act as placeholders, such as the unplayable cyberpunk music track, the empty system monitor and the mock chat responses. The GitHub task integration currently only outputs CLI commands rather than performing actions.

Overall, the application offers an interesting concept but could be improved by addressing the issues noted above and clarifying which features are fully functional versus demonstrative. Once those improvements are made and the side‑effect‑producing commands are handled with confirmation prompts, the site will provide a more polished and reliable experience.
