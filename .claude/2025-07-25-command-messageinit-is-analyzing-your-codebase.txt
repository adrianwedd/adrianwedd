     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
     ## Development Commands
     ### Testing
     - `npm test` - Run Playwright end-to-end tests
     - `npm run test:e2e` - Run only e2e tests in `/tests/e2e/`
     - `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests in `/tests/unit/`

⏺ I've successfully analyzed your codebase and created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file. The file provides essential guidance for future Claude Code instances working in this repository,
  including:

  Key Information Captured:
  - Complete npm script commands for testing, linting, formatting, and building
  - Detailed architecture overview of the interactive terminal application
  - Core design patterns and external integrations
  - Testing strategy with Playwright configuration
  - Development guidelines for maintaining the authentic terminal aesthetic

  Architecture Highlights:
  - Vanilla JavaScript modular design with sophisticated AI service integration
  - Advanced prompt caching following Anthropic best practices
  - WebGL-powered audio synthesis and real-time visualizations
  - Voice interface with wake word detection
  - GitHub Actions and API integrations for live data

  The CLAUDE.md file focuses on the big-picture architecture that requires understanding multiple files, avoiding obvious instructions, and providing the specific technical context
  needed for productive development in this unique retro terminal interface project.
