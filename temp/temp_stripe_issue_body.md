The request is to implement an 'insert coin' Stripe payment feature. A search of the codebase for existing payment-related code (Stripe, payment, billing) yielded no results, indicating this is a new implementation.

**Current State:**
No existing payment processing integration.

**Proposed Resolution:**
Implement a Stripe payment feature, which would involve:
1.  **Frontend Integration:**
    *   Add a UI element (e.g., an 'insert coin' button) to trigger the payment flow.
    *   Integrate Stripe.js to handle client-side payment collection securely.
    *   Implement a callback mechanism to notify the terminal of successful payments.
2.  **Backend Integration (New API Endpoint):**
    *   Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/api/create-payment-intent`) to interact with the Stripe API.
    *   This endpoint would be responsible for:
        *   Creating a Payment Intent on the server-side.
        *   Handling webhooks from Stripe for payment status updates.
        *   Verifying payment success and updating user status/features accordingly.
3.  **Feature Gating:** Implement logic to gate certain features behind a successful payment (e.g., unlock premium terminal themes, extended AI chat limits, etc.).
4.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Provide clear messages for payment failures, cancellations, and successful transactions.
