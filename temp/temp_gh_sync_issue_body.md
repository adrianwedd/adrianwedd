The `gh-sync` command is present in `availableCommands` and the `executeCommand` switch statement, but its functionality to synchronize GitHub issues is not fully implemented. This issue tracks its proper implementation.

**Current State:**
`gh-sync` is recognized by the terminal, but its `handleGhSyncCommand` likely contains placeholder or incomplete logic.

**Affected Code (example context from `assets/terminal.js`):**
```javascript
            case 'gh-list':
                this.addDebugLog(`Handling gh-list command with args: ${args.join(' ')}`, 'info', 'command');
                this.handleGhListCommand(args);
                break;
            case 'gh-sync':
                this.addDebugLog(`Handling gh-sync command with args: ${args.join(' ')}`, 'info', 'command');
                this.handleGhSyncCommand(args);
                break;
            case 'adrian':
                this.addDebugLog('Showing Adrian logo', 'info', 'command');
                this.showAdrianLogo();
                break;
```

**Proposed Resolution:**
Implement `handleGhSyncCommand` to:
1.  Synchronize local task/todo lists with GitHub issues.
2.  Potentially fetch updates from GitHub and apply them locally, or push local changes to GitHub.
3.  Handle conflicts and provide clear feedback to the user.
4.  Explore potential subcommands for `gh-sync`, such as `gh-sync pull`, `gh-sync push`, `gh-sync dry-run`.
