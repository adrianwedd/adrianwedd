The `exec` command is present in `availableCommands` and the `executeCommand` switch statement, but its functionality is entirely missing. This issue tracks its full implementation.

**Current State:**
`exec` is recognized by the terminal, but the `handleExecCommand` function is not defined, resulting in no action when invoked.

**Affected Code (example context from `assets/terminal.js`):**
```javascript
            case 'edit':
                this.addDebugLog(`Handling edit command with args: ${args.join(' ')}`, 'info', 'command');
                this.handleEditCommand(args);
                break;
            case 'exec':
                this.addDebugLog(`Handling exec command with args: ${args.join(' ')}`, 'info', 'command');
                this.handleExecCommand(args);
                break;
            case 'grep':
                this.addDebugLog(`Handling grep command with args: ${args.join(' ')}`, 'info', 'command');
                this.handleGrepCommand(args);
                break;
```

**Proposed Resolution:**
Implement `handleExecCommand` to:
1.  Allow execution of scripts or shell commands passed as arguments.
2.  Integrate with the existing `script` command's functionality for script execution.
3.  Provide appropriate security warnings and considerations for executing arbitrary commands.
4.  Consider subcommands for `exec`, such as `exec script <name>` or `exec shell <command>`.
