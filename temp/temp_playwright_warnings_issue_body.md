The `playwright.config.cjs` file has been reviewed, and no configurations within it are found to be directly causing Playwright warnings. Playwright warnings usually stem from issues within the test files themselves or the application being tested.

**Current State:**
Playwright tests are generating warnings during execution.

**Affected Files (potential sources of warnings):**
- `tests/**/*.spec.js` (or similar test file patterns)
- `assets/**/*.js` (application JavaScript files)
- `index.html` (application HTML structure and resource loading)

**Proposed Investigation & Resolution:**
1.  **Examine Playwright Test Output:** The most crucial step is to analyze the full Playwright test output (e.g., from CI/CD logs or local runs) to identify the specific warning messages and their origins (file and line number).
2.  **Review Test Files:** Look for deprecated Playwright API usage, inefficient selectors, or race conditions in the test code.
3.  **Inspect Application Console:** Run the application locally and check the browser's developer console for any warnings or errors that Playwright might be capturing.
4.  **Check Resource Loading:** Verify that all assets (images, scripts, stylesheets) are loading correctly and without errors.
5.  **Address Specific Warnings:** Based on the identified warnings, implement targeted fixes in the relevant test files or application code.
