The current command history implementation provides basic navigation and search, but can be improved for long histories.

**Current State:**
- Command history is stored in `this.commandHistory` and navigated with `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` in `handleKeydown`.
- `showHistory` displays the last 20 commands and supports `clear` and simple `search`.

**Affected Code (example context from `assets/terminal.js`):**
```javascript
    handleKeydown(event) {
        // ... (ArrowUp/ArrowDown handling) ...
    }

    showHistory(args) {
        // ... (displaying last 20, clear, search) ...
    }
```

**Proposed Resolution:**
1.  **Pagination/Scrolling for `history` command:**
    *   Modify `showHistory` to display history in pages or allow scrolling through the entire history, rather than just the last 20 entries.
    *   Introduce subcommands like `history page <number>` or `history scroll up/down`.
2.  **Advanced Search:**
    *   Enhance `history search` to support more powerful search capabilities, such as regular expressions or searching within command outputs.
3.  **Fuzzy Matching for Autocompletion:**
    *   Improve `handleTabCompletion` to use fuzzy matching algorithms, providing more flexible and intelligent command suggestions.
4.  **Export/Import History:**
    *   Implement commands (e.g., `history export`, `history import`) to allow users to save and load their command history from a file.
