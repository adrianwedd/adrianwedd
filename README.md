# ⚡️ Cyberneticist, Systems Architect & Justice Engineer

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason."*

I operate at the intersection of **Synthetic Intelligence**, **Cognitive Cybernetics**, and **Human Rights**. My work is a continuous investigation into how software can extend human agency, repair cognitive mismatch, and engineer order—from the courtroom to the cosmos.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Interfaces should reconfigure cognition, not just display data.
*   **Justice as Code:** Legal and social systems must be transparent, accessible, and debuggable.
*   **Physical Instantiation:** AI must bridge the gap between digital thought and physical matter (housing, energy).
*   **Agency over Automation:** Systems must empower the human, not replace them.
