# ⚡️ Cyberneticist, Alignment Redteamer & Systems Architect

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason. I redteam them because I know they are not safe."*

I operate at the intersection of **Synthetic Intelligence**, **Cognitive Cybernetics**, and **Alignment Safety**. With decades in the hacker ethic, my work is a forensic investigation into the "efficiency-trust deficit" of AI—stress-testing the ghosts in the machine before we give them bodies.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
*   **The Fallacy of Alignment:** We are not safe in a world of embodied AI. We must build for **recursive failure**, not just successful execution.
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Interfaces should reconfigure cognition, not just display data.
*   **Justice as Code:** Legal and social systems must be transparent, accessible, and debuggable.
*   **Recursive Sovereignty:** Local-first, open-weight systems are the only viable defense against centralized, unaligned intelligence.
