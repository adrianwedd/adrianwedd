# 🛡️ Forensic Sentinel — Systems Architect (Tasmania)

I build agentic and embodied systems that operate under constraint: local-first when possible, audit-first always. I'm interested in the failure that looks like success—quiet drift, misplaced authority, tool misuse, memory contamination—because that's where autonomy becomes unsafe.

The work spans clinical reasoning systems, infrastructure automation on sovereign compute (`vLLM`), and physical-world coordination (a 170‑acre 3D‑printed eco‑village in Tasmania). Seven years in Tasmanian government sharpened the throughline: instrument the system, stress it, translate the findings for decision-makers, and keep a human override that still works when the lights flicker.

## Background

Systems architect with production AI deployment across clinical, infrastructure, and government domains. Seven years in Tasmania's Department of Communities translating technical risk into policy-ready guidance—bridging the gap between what systems do and what stakeholders need to know.

---

## Current Focus

Applying systems forensics to **institutional AI safety**: how organisations detect, document, and respond to AI failure modes at scale. Interested in sovereign evaluation capability—the infrastructure a nation needs to assess frontier AI systems independently, without relying solely on developer self-reporting.

---

## Operating Posture

- **Failure-first safety**: treat breakdowns as primary data; build recovery loops, not "perfect runs".
- **Threat models over vibes**: prompt/tool injection, memory poisoning, silent corruption, over-trust, goal drift, embodied hazard propagation.
- **Sovereign compute**: local-first, open-weight inference where feasible; the cloud is a dependency to be justified, not assumed.
- **Auditability**: event logs, reproducible runs, deterministic fallbacks where they reduce blast radius.
- **Human sovereignty**: explicit handoffs, hard stops, and operator visibility; autonomy is earned by evidence.

---

## Instrumentation (What I Mean By "Forensic")

- **Trace**: capture decisions, tool calls, and memory writes; prefer append-only logs over "final answers".
- **Constrain**: least-privilege tools, explicit scopes, and reversible operations by default.
- **Degrade**: partial failure should reduce capability, not create unpredictable behavior.
- **Reproduce**: convert incidents into harnesses; keep them failing until the system learns how to recover.

## Flagships (Systems Under Test)

### 🛡️ failure-first-embodied-ai
**[failure-first-embodied-ai](https://github.com/adrianwedd/failure-first-embodied-ai)** — Red-teaming and benchmarking for embodied and agentic systems where **recursive failure** is the object of study.

What I care about here:
- **Failure taxonomies** that survive contact with reality (not just academic categories).
- **Adversarial scenarios** that stress tool use, memory, and feedback loops.
- **Scoring that punishes "confident wrong"** and rewards detection + recovery, not just completion.

This is the kind of evaluation infrastructure I believe national AI safety institutes need: adversarial, reproducible, and focused on the failures that look like success.

### ❤️‍🔥 Dx0 (Sequential Clinical Reasoning)
**[Dx0](https://github.com/adrianwedd/Dx0)** — A multi-agent clinical suite for sequential diagnosis, simulating physician panels to solve NEJM pathological cases.

I treat this as an interface problem under uncertainty: differential narrowing, evidence tracking, disagreement capture, and failure modes like anchoring and narrative overfit. The methods translate directly to risk assessment in any high-stakes domain. (Not medical advice; not a medical device.)

### ⚙️ PAOS (Personal Agentic Operating System)
**[personal-agentic-operating-system](https://github.com/adrianwedd/personal-agentic-operating-system)** — A local-first agentic OS with a **meta-agent loop** that refines system guidelines from reflection logs at runtime.

The point is not "self-improvement". The point is **traceable adaptation**: what changed, why, and what it broke. Governance requires knowing when an AI system has modified its own behaviour.

### 🧠 Neurodiversity & Field Support
**[ADHDo](https://github.com/adrianwedd/ADHDo)** — A neurodiversity-affirming support system built by ADHD brains for ADHD brains: detects overwhelm patterns and offers de-escalation prompts and structure.

**[thiswasntinthebrochure.wtf](https://thiswasntinthebrochure.wtf)** — A practical field guide to co-parenting neurodivergent children (ADHD, Autism, PDA, ODD).

These are not "content projects" to me; they're applied cognitive forensics: reduce shame, increase signal, and keep humans in control when the nervous system is already at capacity.

### 🏗️ Cygnet (Physical World Coordination)
**[cygnet](https://github.com/adrianwedd/cygnet)** — AI coordination of a **170-acre 3D-printed eco-village** in Tasmania: construction, land, and print ops across 28+ agents.

Current state (because reality matters):
- We have the **170 acres**.
- There is currently a **~$1.5M gap** for purchasing the 3D printer, so the build program is staged accordingly.

Physical systems are unforgiving: you don't get to "retry" a safety incident. The design bias is toward operator visibility, conservative actuation, and graceful degradation.

## Methods (What Actually Happens When I "Redteam")

- **Pre-mortems**: enumerate plausible failure routes before the first demo.
- **Adversarial prompts + tool misuse**: test boundary break attempts, escalation paths, and "helpful" overreach.
- **Memory forensics**: probe contamination, leakage, and persistence of incorrect beliefs.
- **Authority tests**: verify that the system can say "no", ask for confirmation, and stop when uncertainty is high.
- **Deterministic backstops**: where an algorithmic fallback (e.g., `grid2_repo` beam search) is safer than a generative guess, I use it.
- **Regression pressure**: turn interesting failures into repeatable harnesses and keep them failing until they stop.
- **Governance translation**: convert technical findings into policy-ready language for non-technical stakeholders without losing fidelity.
- **Post-incident writing**: document what happened in plain language, what the system inferred, and where the operator lost visibility.

I build systems that remember. Then I verify what they remember, how they learned it, and what they'll do with it when the inputs get strange.
