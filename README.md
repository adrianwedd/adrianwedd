# ⚡️ Recursive Systems Architect & Digital Archaeologist

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason."*

I operate at the bleeding edge where **Synthetic Intelligence** meets **Neuro-Symbiosis**. I don't just write scripts; I cultivate ecosystems where software creates, optimizes, and understands itself.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
The future isn't about faster calculators. It's about:
*   **Agency over Automation:** Moving beyond static workflows to self-evolving architectures.
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Using LLMs to patch the gaps in executive function.
*   **Digital Archaeology:** Mining the "noise" of the past to create the textures of the future.

### 🧠 Synthetic Minds (AI & Agents)
*Attempts to teach silicon how to think.*

*   **[Agentic-Index](https://github.com/adrianwedd/Agentic-Index)**: The definitive cartography of the autonomous agent landscape.
*   **[AI-SWA](https://github.com/adrianwedd/AI-SWA)**: A self-evolving software architect that reasons about its own design and rewrites its own DNA.
*   **[TEL3SIS](https://github.com/adrianwedd/TEL3SIS)**: Telephony-linked embedded intelligence. Voice-to-voice, real-time, human-aware.

### ❤️‍🔥 Neuro-Symbiosis (Health & Accessibility)
*Code as a support structure for the human mind.*

*   **[ADHDo](https://github.com/adrianwedd/ADHDo)**: An AI co-pilot for executive dysfunction. Crisis detection, dopamine-sized task breaking, and circuit breakers for the brain.
*   **[emdr-agent](https://github.com/adrianwedd/emdr-agent)**: Therapeutic protocols digitized for accessibility.
*   **[This Wasn't in the Brochure](https://github.com/adrianwedd/thiswasntinthebrochure)**: A nautical voyage through neurodivergent co-parenting.

### 🌑 Sonic Archaeology (Art & Audio)
*Distilling memories from the noise.*

*   **[afterglow-engine](https://github.com/adrianwedd/afterglow-engine)**: A machine for sonic archaeology. It unweaves audio archives to separate pigment from gesture.
*   **[latent-self](https://github.com/adrianwedd/latent-self)**: Confronting the mirror in the age of generative identity.
