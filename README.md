# ⚡️ Cyberneticist & Systems Architect

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason."*

I operate at the intersection of **Synthetic Intelligence**, **Cognitive Cybernetics**, and **Industrial Sovereignty**. My work is a continuous investigation into how software can extend human agency, repair cognitive mismatch, and engineer order from entropy.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Interfaces should reconfigure cognition, not just display data.
*   **Agency over Automation:** Systems must empower the human, not replace them.
*   **Digital Archaeology:** We must mine the "noise" of the past to create the textures of the future.
*   **Deterministic Sovereignty:** Bridging the gap between generative chaos and industrial reliability.

*Forensic readings of the interface.*

*   **[Before the Words Existed](https://github.com/adrianwedd/before-the-words-existed)**: A forensic, experiential reading of *Neuromancer*. Investigating "cognitive mismatch" before the clinical vocabulary existed.
*   **[latent-self](https://github.com/adrianwedd/latent-self)**: Confronting the mirror in the age of generative identity. An interactive installation probing the boundaries of self.

### ❤️‍🔥 Neuro-Symbiosis (Health & Accessibility)
*Code as a support structure for the human mind.*
