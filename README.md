# ⚡️ Cyberneticist, Sentinel & Systems Architect

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason. I redteam them because I know they are not safe."*

Operating from the edge of the world (**Tasmania**), I bridge the gap between **Synthetic Intelligence** and **Human Sovereignty**. With decades rooted in the hacker ethic, my work is a forensic investigation into the "efficiency-trust deficit" of AI—architecting autonomous cognition while stress-testing the ghosts in the machine.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
*   **The Fallacy of Alignment:** We are not safe in a world of embodied AI. We must build for **recursive failure**, not just successful execution.
*   **Sovereign Compute:** True agency requires local-first, open-weight systems. The cloud is a rented brain; I build owned minds.
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Interfaces must reconfigure cognition, extending the human mind rather than replacing it.
*   **Justice as Code:** Legal and social systems must be transparent, accessible, and debuggable.
