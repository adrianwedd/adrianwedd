# ⚡️ Systems Architect & AI Sentinel

> *"I build machines that remember, systems that heal, and agents that reason. I redteam them because I know they are not safe."*

Operating from the edge of the world (**Tasmania**), I bridge the gap between **Synthetic Intelligence** and **Human Sovereignty**. My work ranges from multi-agent clinical diagnostic systems to the coordination of 3D-printed eco-villages—always forensically stress-testing the ghosts in the machine.

### 🏴 The Manifesto
*   **The Fallacy of Alignment:** We are not safe in a world of embodied AI. We must build for **recursive failure**, not just successful execution.
*   **Failure-First Engineering:** Safety is not a binary property achieved at deployment; it is an interactional state maintained through recovery and human-in-the-loop oversight.
*   **Sovereign Compute:** True agency requires local-first, open-weight systems. The cloud is a rented brain; I build owned minds.
*   **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Interfaces should reconfigure cognition, extending the human mind rather than replacing it.
