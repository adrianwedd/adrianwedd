# **Cygnet Project: Reporting & Alerting Specification**

## **Executive Summary**

The Cygnet project has reached a pivotal stage where its operational complexity necessitates a significant evolution in its business intelligence (BI) and monitoring capabilities. The current static dashboard, while valuable, is a reactive tool in an environment that increasingly demands proactive, data-driven, and automated control. This document provides a comprehensive specification for the design and development of an advanced Reporting and Alerting System. The proposed system is architected to serve two distinct but interconnected audiences: human stakeholders requiring customizable, intuitive insights, and the project's autonomous agent ecosystem, which requires structured, real-time data feeds to enable adaptive workflows and automated task management.

The core of this new ecosystem is built upon three foundational pillars: stakeholder-customizable reporting, real-time operational dashboards, and an event-driven alerting engine. The reporting module will empower stakeholders, from financial controllers to construction leads, to generate on-demand reports in various formats (PDF, CSV), tailored to their specific analytical needs. The real-time dashboards will provide an immediate, live view of critical, fast-moving project metrics, such as construction printer status and material consumption rates. The alerting engine will move the project from a passive monitoring stance to an active response posture, automatically triggering notifications and, crucially, machine-readable payloads to the Cygnet agent ecosystem when predefined thresholds are breached or critical events occur.

After a rigorous evaluation of leading BI platforms and custom development options, this specification recommends a hybrid technology stack. This architecture leverages **Microsoft Power BI** for its robust enterprise-grade reporting, data modeling, and ad-hoc analysis capabilities, making it the ideal platform for strategic and financial oversight. For high-frequency operational monitoring and real-time event triggering, the recommendation is to implement **Grafana**, a platform purpose-built for time-series data visualization and sophisticated, webhook-based alerting. This dual-platform approach ensures that each component of the system is built on a technology best suited for its specific function, maximizing performance, reliability, and extensibility.

The expected impact of this system is transformative. It will significantly reduce the hours spent on manual report generation, accelerate issue response times from days to seconds through automated alerts, and unlock the full potential of the Cygnet agent ecosystem. By providing agents with the real-time intelligence needed to adapt plans, re-sequence tasks, and flag anomalies, this system will become the central nervous system of the project, enhancing operational efficiency, mitigating risks, and driving more predictable and successful project outcomes.

## **Section 1: Consolidated Requirements & Prioritization Framework**

This section synthesizes the intelligence needs of all project participants—both human and autonomous—into a unified framework. It translates the strategic objectives outlined in the research brief into a concrete, prioritized set of features that will serve as the master blueprint for the system's development. The requirements analysis reveals a clear bifurcation of needs: strategic, analytical reporting for management and finance, and high-frequency, real-time monitoring for operational teams and automated agents.

### **1.1. Human Stakeholder Intelligence Needs**

Interviews with key project stakeholders have identified distinct requirements for data content, format, and interaction, underscoring the inadequacy of a one-size-fits-all reporting solution. The needs are persona-driven, tied directly to the specific decisions and responsibilities of each role.

* **Financial Controller Persona:** This role is responsible for fiscal oversight and reporting to the project board. The primary need is for periodic, high-fidelity reports on financial health.  
  * **Content:** Detailed budget versus actuals, cost-to-complete projections, and variance analysis, with the ability to drill down from the project level to individual task expenditures.  
  * **Format & Interaction:** Requires weekly and monthly summaries formatted as board-ready PDFs for formal reporting and archival. Additionally, requires raw data exports in CSV format for further analysis in external financial modeling software.1 The system must support both static, presentational outputs and flexible, raw data extraction.  
  * **Alerting:** Critical alerts must be triggered when any task's expenditure exceeds 90% of its allocated budget, enabling proactive cost control before overruns occur.  
* **BuildCo Lead Persona:** This role is responsible for the day-to-day execution of construction and fabrication. The primary need is for immediate, real-time operational awareness.  
  * **Content:** A live dashboard displaying the status of critical machinery (e.g., printer status: Idle, Printing, Error), current material consumption rates, and a list of open tasks on the critical path.  
  * **Format & Interaction:** A persistent, heads-up display optimized for a large screen on the construction floor. The ability to generate a printable "end-of-shift" summary is also required. This points toward tools designed for real-time monitoring, such as Grafana or a custom D3.js implementation.3  
  * **Alerting:** Requires immediate, high-visibility notifications for critical events, such as a printer error or a delay of more than 24 hours on a task with critical dependencies.  
* **Project Manager Persona:** This role requires a holistic, integrated view of the entire project to balance scope, schedule, and budget.  
  * **Content:** A comprehensive dashboard that integrates financial health, schedule adherence (Gantt chart progress vs. baseline), and resource allocation metrics.  
  * **Format & Interaction:** Must have the ability to perform self-service, ad-hoc analysis. This includes filtering and segmenting data by arbitrary date ranges, project phases, or business units to answer emergent questions without developer intervention. This highlights the need for a user-friendly query builder, a noted strength of platforms like Metabase.3  
  * **Alerting:** Needs to be notified of any alerts triggered for the Financial Controller or BuildCo Lead, serving as a central point of contact for all project anomalies.

The diversity in these requirements, from static PDFs to interactive, real-time dashboards and raw data exports, confirms that the selected technology stack must be exceptionally versatile in its data presentation and export capabilities.

**Table 1: Stakeholder Requirements Matrix**

| Stakeholder Role | Key Metrics | Required Formats | Critical Alerts |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Financial Controller** | Budget vs. Actuals, Variance, Cost-to-Complete | PDF (Weekly/Monthly), CSV (On-Demand) | Task budget exceeds 90% |
| **BuildCo Lead** | Printer Status, Material Consumption Rate, Critical Path Task Status | Live Dashboard, Printable Daily Summary | Printer Error, Critical Dependency Delay \> 24h |
| **Project Manager** | Schedule Adherence, Resource Allocation, Integrated Financials | Interactive Dashboard, Ad-hoc Reports | All critical financial and operational alerts |

### **1.2. Agent Ecosystem Data & Trigger Protocols**

A core design principle of this system is to function as a primary data source and command initiator for the Cygnet agent ecosystem. This requires more than just data access; it necessitates an event-driven architecture where agents can react to project events in real time. The reliance on polling APIs for status updates is inefficient and introduces unacceptable latency for time-critical automated responses. Therefore, robust support for webhooks, which push notifications to agents the moment an event occurs, is a foundational architectural requirement.6

* **CODEFORGE Agent (Workflow & Task Management):** CODEFORGE is responsible for dynamic task planning and execution. It needs to receive structured event payloads to trigger adaptive workflows.  
  * **Data Needs:** Consumes alert payloads in a well-defined JSON or YAML format. For example, a DependencyDelayed alert must contain the taskId, dependencyId, delayDuration, and newEstimatedCompletionDate to allow CODEFORGE to automatically calculate impacts and re-sequence downstream tasks.  
  * **Trigger Protocol:** Subscribes to a webhook endpoint that receives notifications for events related to schedule, budget, and task dependencies.  
* **ResearchOracle Agent (Planning & Estimation):** ResearchOracle informs future project planning by analyzing historical performance. It requires queryable access to the project's data warehouse.  
  * **Data Needs:** Requires a stable, versioned REST API to programmatically query historical project data, such as the average time and cost to complete tasks of a certain type. This capability is a hallmark of mature BI platforms like Tableau and Power BI.9  
  * **Trigger Protocol:** Primarily uses API polling on a scheduled basis (e.g., nightly) to update its internal models, but may also be triggered by specific events like ProjectPhaseComplete to initiate a look-back analysis.  
* **LUMEN Agent (Resource & Logistics Monitoring):** LUMEN is tasked with monitoring the physical aspects of the project, including resource consumption and hardware status.  
  * **Data Needs:** Requires a real-time data feed for metrics like material consumption rates and printer telemetry. A sudden, anomalous spike in material usage could indicate a leak or fabrication error that requires immediate investigation.  
  * **Trigger Protocol:** Subscribes to high-frequency webhooks triggered by the real-time monitoring system. An alert for AnomalousMaterialConsumption would trigger LUMEN to dispatch a diagnostic sub-task.

**Table 2: Agent Data & Trigger Matrix**

| Agent Class | Data Requirements | Trigger Mechanism | Example Payload Snippet (YAML) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CODEFORGE** | Task status, dependencies, budget state | Webhook (Event-Driven) | eventType: alert.dependency.delayed taskId: TSK-789 delayDuration: "48h" |
| **ResearchOracle** | Historical project performance data | REST API (Scheduled/On-Demand) | GET /api/v1/tasks?type=fabrication response: { "avgDuration": "72h" } |
| **LUMEN** | Real-time material consumption, printer telemetry | Webhook (Real-Time Event) | eventType: alert.printer.statusError printerId: PRINTER-01 errorCode: "E-501" |

### **1.3. Master Feature Prioritization**

To guide a logical and value-driven implementation, all requirements gathered from human and agent stakeholders have been consolidated into a master feature list. Each feature has been scored against three criteria to establish a clear development priority.

* **Scoring Criteria:**  
  1. **Impact (1-5):** The degree to which the feature improves a stakeholder's workflow, an agent's effectiveness, or the project's overall risk posture.  
  2. **Urgency (1-5):** The frequency with which the information or trigger is needed (e.g., a real-time metric has higher urgency than a monthly report).  
  3. **Dependency (1-5):** The extent to which other high-priority features rely on this one being implemented first (e.g., data source integration is a dependency for all reports).  
* **Prioritized Tiers:**  
  * **Priority 1 (MVP):** Foundational features required for basic operational control. This includes core financial reporting (FIN-001), the real-time operational dashboard (OPS-001), and critical alerts for budget overruns (ALERT-FIN-01) and printer failures (ALERT-OPS-01). These features address the most urgent needs of the primary stakeholders and establish the core data pipelines.  
  * **Priority 2 (Phase 2):** Features that expand analytical capabilities and enhance automation. This includes advanced ad-hoc reporting for the Project Manager, integration with additional data sources, and the implementation of secondary alerts (e.g., dependency delays, anomalous consumption).  
  * **Priority 3 (Future Enhancements):** Features that provide predictive insights and further optimization, such as machine learning-driven forecasting and integration with the full suite of Cygnet agents.

This prioritized framework ensures that development efforts are focused on delivering maximum value at each stage of the project rollout.

## **Section 2: System Architecture & Technology Stack Analysis**

This section presents a rigorous technical evaluation of potential technology stacks, culminating in a definitive architectural recommendation tailored to the unique dual-audience and agent-driven requirements of the Cygnet project. The analysis concludes that a single, monolithic platform cannot optimally satisfy the project's diverse needs for both strategic business intelligence and real-time operational monitoring. Consequently, a hybrid architecture is proposed.

### **2.1. Comparative Analysis of Business Intelligence Platforms**

The selection of the right BI platform is critical. The evaluation was based on five key criteria derived directly from the project's core requirements: Agent Integration Capability, Real-Time Data Handling, Customization & Extensibility, User Experience for non-technical stakeholders, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

* **Tableau:** A market leader in data visualization, Tableau offers a mature and powerful platform.  
  * **Strengths:** Its REST API is extensive, providing programmatic control over content, users, and data sources.9 A key differentiator is its dedicated Webhooks API, which can trigger external workflows based on events like extract refreshes or workbook creation, making it highly suitable for agent integration.7 It also provides robust, multi-format export capabilities.1  
  * **Weaknesses:** The pricing model is complex, with tiered licenses for Creators, Explorers, and Viewers, and separate costs for advanced add-ons, which can lead to a high TCO.13 Its real-time capabilities are often dependent on scheduled data extract refreshes, which may not meet the low-latency requirements for operational monitoring.  
* **Microsoft Power BI:** A strong contender, particularly for organizations within the Microsoft ecosystem.  
  * **Strengths:** Power BI features a comprehensive REST API for programmatic report and data management.10 Its primary advantage for agent-based workflows is its seamless, native integration with Power Automate. This allows data-driven alerts within Power BI to trigger complex, multi-step workflows with minimal code, effectively serving as a powerful webhook and actioning engine.16 The pricing is often more competitive than Tableau's, especially for enterprises with existing Microsoft 365 E5 licenses.18  
  * **Weaknesses:** The exportToFile API is asynchronous, meaning a client application must call the API to start a job and then poll for completion, which adds a layer of complexity for agents that require an immediate, synchronous data response.10  
* **Grafana:** An open-source platform purpose-built for observability and real-time monitoring.  
  * **Strengths:** Grafana excels at visualizing high-frequency, time-series data, making it the ideal choice for the operational dashboard monitoring printer status and material consumption.3 Its most compelling feature for this project is its powerful and flexible alerting engine. Alerts can be configured with complex conditions and can trigger notifications to a wide range of "contact points," including a highly customizable webhook notifier that can send detailed JSON payloads directly to the agent ecosystem.8  
  * **Weaknesses:** While excellent for metrics and logs, it is not designed for the complex, relational data modeling and ad-hoc business intelligence queries that the financial and management stakeholders require.  
* **Metabase:** An open-source BI tool renowned for its simplicity and ease of use.  
  * **Strengths:** Its primary advantage is its user-friendly interface, which empowers non-technical users to perform self-service analytics and answer their own data questions without relying on developers.3 It has a comprehensive API that exposes most application functions and supports data export to JSON, CSV, and XLSX.20  
  * **Weaknesses:** The API is explicitly un-versioned and subject to change between releases, which introduces significant risk and maintenance overhead for long-term automation scripts.20 It lacks a native, event-driven webhook system for alerts, meaning agent triggers would have to be implemented via less efficient API polling.  
* **Custom D3.js Solution:** A from-scratch build using the D3.js JavaScript library.  
  * **Strengths:** Offers virtually unlimited flexibility to create bespoke, highly interactive, and dynamic data visualizations that are perfectly tailored to specific requirements.4  
  * **Weaknesses:** This approach represents a prohibitively high development effort and cost. It would require a team of specialized developers to build not only the visualizations but also all the surrounding BI infrastructure (user management, permissions, scheduling, data connectors, export functions) that off-the-shelf platforms provide out-of-the-box.4

**Table 3: BI Platform Evaluation Scorecard**

| Criterion | Tableau | Power BI | Grafana | Metabase | D3.js Custom |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Agent Integration (API/Webhooks)** | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 |
| **Real-Time Data Handling** | 3/5 | 3/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | 5/5 |
| **Customization & Extensibility** | 4/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 | 5/5 |
| **User Experience (Non-Technical)** | 4/5 | 3/5 | 3/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 |
| **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | 2/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 1/5 |
| **Overall Score** | 3.6 | 3.8 | 4.2 | 3.8 | 3.4 |

### **2.2. Recommended Architectural Blueprint**

The analysis indicates that no single tool excels across all criteria. The project's needs are best met by a hybrid architecture that leverages the distinct strengths of both an enterprise BI platform and a real-time monitoring tool.

The recommended blueprint is as follows:

1. **Data Sources:** Raw data from Financial Software, Project Management Tools, and IoT/Printer APIs are ingested.  
2. **ETL & Data Warehouse:** Data is extracted, transformed, and loaded into a central data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, or a SQL Server). This layer standardizes and models the data, creating a single source of truth for strategic analysis.  
3. **Business Intelligence Layer (Power BI):** Power BI connects to the data warehouse. It serves the needs of the Financial Controller and Project Manager, providing complex, relational reporting, ad-hoc analysis, and dashboards. Agent access for historical data (e.g., for ResearchOracle) is provided via the Power BI REST API. Alerts requiring complex business logic are configured here and trigger workflows via Power Automate.  
4. **Real-Time Monitoring Layer (Grafana):** Grafana connects directly to high-frequency data sources (either via a time-series database like Prometheus or directly to streaming APIs). It serves the real-time operational dashboard for the BuildCo Lead. Its alerting engine monitors these streams and sends immediate, structured webhook notifications directly to the Agent Tasking Ecosystem for time-critical events.  
5. **Presentation & Actioning Layer:** Human stakeholders interact with the system via the Power BI and Grafana web interfaces. The Agent Tasking Ecosystem acts as a central hub, consuming data from both Power BI API calls and Grafana webhooks to dispatch tasks to the appropriate agents (CODEFORGE, LUMEN, etc.).

This decoupled architecture allows each component to perform optimally. Power BI handles the heavy lifting of business analytics, while Grafana provides the low-latency monitoring and event-driven alerting crucial for operational control and agent reactivity.

### **2.3. Justification for Technology Stack Selection**

The recommendation for a hybrid Power BI and Grafana architecture is based on a "best tool for the job" philosophy, directly addressing the project's dual requirements.

* **Power BI for Core Business Intelligence:** Power BI is selected as the primary enterprise BI tool due to its powerful data modeling capabilities, strong API, and market-leading integration with Power Automate.16 This integration provides a mature, low-code, and highly extensible solution for creating the complex, conditional workflows required by agents like CODEFORGE without requiring extensive custom development. Its competitive TCO, particularly within existing Microsoft environments, makes it a financially prudent choice.18  
* **Grafana for Real-Time Operations & Alerting:** Grafana is selected for its unparalleled performance with real-time, time-series data streams.3 This is essential for the operational dashboard's sub-second data refresh requirements. More importantly, its native webhook alerting system is the most direct, efficient, and reliable method to implement the event-driven triggers required by agents like LUMEN.8 It allows for the creation of highly customized JSON payloads that can be directly consumed by agents, minimizing middleware and potential points of failure.  
* **Dismissal of Alternatives:** While strong contenders, the other options were deemed less suitable. A custom **D3.js** solution was dismissed due to its excessive development cost and the high risk of building and maintaining a full BI platform from scratch.4  
  **Metabase**, despite its excellent user experience, was not selected due to the risks associated with its un-versioned API and its lack of a native, push-based webhook system for real-time agent triggering.20  
  **Tableau** is a very capable alternative to Power BI, but its more complex pricing and the fact that its webhook system is less integrated with a broader workflow automation tool like Power Automate made Power BI the slightly preferred choice for the core BI component.

### **4.2. Prototype & Mockup Appendix**

A comprehensive appendix containing high-fidelity visual mockups for all specified dashboards and report layouts will be provided alongside this specification. These mockups serve as a visual contract between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring alignment on the user interface and user experience before significant development effort is expended. This visual guide will be used during UAT to validate that the final product meets the agreed-upon design and functionality.

### **4.3. Agent Integration & Testing Strategy**

Validating the seamless and reliable interaction between the BI system and the agent ecosystem is the most critical success factor for this project. The following end-to-end test cases will be used to verify this integration.

* **Test Case 1: Budget Threshold Alert Workflow**  
  * **System Under Test:** Power BI, Power Automate, CODEFORGE Agent.  
  * **Procedure:**  
    1. In a staging database, manually update the actual\_spend for a designated task to a value that is 95% of its planned\_budget.  
    2. Manually trigger the data refresh in Power BI and the corresponding Power Automate flow.  
  * **Expected Outcome:**  
    1. The Power BI data alert for ALERT-FIN-01 is triggered.  
    2. The Power Automate flow executes successfully.  
    3. The CODEFORGE agent's webhook endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON/YAML payload matching the specified schema for ALERT-FIN-01.  
    4. The CODEFORGE agent logs a "Task TSK-XYZ flagged for budget review" action.  
    5. The Financial Controller's test email account receives the correct alert notification.  
* **Test Case 2: Real-Time Printer Failure and Response**  
  * **System Under Test:** Grafana, LUMEN Agent, CODEFORGE Agent.  
  * **Procedure:**  
    1. Utilize a mock API script to simulate the printer's telemetry endpoint, forcing it to return a status of Error with a specific error code.  
    2. Maintain this error state for at least 65 seconds.  
  * **Expected Outcome:**  
    1. The OPS-001 dashboard in Grafana updates its printerStatus panel to "Error" within 5 seconds of the API change.  
    2. After 60 seconds, the Grafana alert for ALERT-OPS-01 enters a FIRING state.  
    3. The webhook endpoints for both the LUMEN and CODEFORGE agents receive a POST request with a payload matching the schema for ALERT-OPS-01.  
    4. The LUMEN agent logs the initiation of a diagnostic task on PRINTER-01.  
    5. The CODEFORGE agent logs that the current printing task has been paused and dependent tasks are under review.  
* **Success Criteria:**
