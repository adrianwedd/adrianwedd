# **Guide to Structural Engineering & Certification for 3DCP in Tasmania**

### **Executive Summary**

**Statement of Purpose:** This report provides a definitive and actionable guide for achieving structural engineering certification and regulatory approval for the Cygnet 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) project under the Tasmanian building framework. It is intended to transform regulatory ambiguity into a clear, compliant, and defensible engineering strategy for all project stakeholders.

**Primary Finding:** The only viable compliance pathway for a novel construction system such as 3DCP is a **Performance Solution** as defined by the National Construction Code (NCC). The conventional Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) pathway, which relies on prescribed methods for standard materials, is inapplicable to this project.

**Recommended Strategy:** A proactive, four-step process is recommended, centered on the development of a comprehensive **Performance-Based Design Brief (PBDB)**. This document must be created in direct collaboration with the project's appointed specialist building surveyor and structural engineer. The PBDB will serve as the agreed-upon roadmap for compliance, defining the acceptance criteria against which the project will be assessed.

**Critical Dependencies:** The success of this strategy is contingent upon several key factors:

* A rigorous and extensive material testing program must be undertaken to verify the structural properties of the proprietary printed concrete. This program must be benchmarked against established Australian Standards, primarily AS 3600 *Concrete Structures* and the AS 1012 series for testing methods.  
* The project must leverage existing precedent as "Evidence of Suitability." The **BRANZ Appraisal No. 1218** for the QOROX 3DCP system in New Zealand serves as a critical template, demonstrating the level of engineering substantiation required to satisfy a regulator.  
* Under Tasmania's *Building Act 2016*, the project will be classified as **"High Risk (Permit Work)."** This classification mandates a full Building Permit application to the Huon Valley Council, which follows the successful technical certification by the building surveyor.

**Key Actionable Outcomes:** This guide provides a detailed process map for the entire certification journey, comprehensive checklists for all required documentation, and a specific material testing plan. By following this guide, the project team can systematically de-risk the regulatory approval phase, prevent costly delays, and proceed with confidence in its engineering and compliance strategy.

## **Part 1: The National Construction Code (NCC) and its Application to Innovative Structures**

This section establishes the foundational regulatory principles at a national level, demonstrating that the National Construction Code is designed to accommodate, rather than prohibit, innovation like 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP).

### **1.1 The Performance-Based Code: A Framework for Innovation**

The National Construction Code (NCC) is Australia's primary set of technical design and construction provisions for buildings.1 Its fundamental structure is that of a performance-based code. This is a critical distinction from more rigid, prescriptive codes found in other parts of the world. The NCC sets the minimum required levels for safety, health, amenity, accessibility, and sustainability, but it does so by defining

*what* must be achieved (the Performance Requirements) rather than dictating *how* it must be achieved.1

This performance-based philosophy is the project's greatest asset, as it explicitly creates a pathway for new technologies. The NCC states that there is no obligation to adopt any particular material, component, design factor, or construction method.2 This provides a choice of compliance pathways and is specifically intended to encourage innovative design and the use of new technology.3 For a novel system like 3DCP, which is not described in any prescriptive "recipe book" standard, this framework provides the legal and technical mechanism for approval. The project is not seeking an exemption from the code; it is following a defined, albeit more rigorous, compliance path that is built into the code's structure. This reframes the conversation with regulators from "Can we do this?" to "This is the Performance Solution we have developed to meet the NCC's Performance Requirements, and here is our comprehensive evidence package." This places the project in a much stronger strategic position of demonstrating compliance rather than seeking permission.

### **1.2 Foundational Structural Requirements (NCC Volume One, Part B1 & Volume Two, Part 2.2)**

The structural integrity of the Cygnet project will be assessed against the mandatory Performance Requirements outlined in Section B of the NCC.

#### **1.2.1 B1P1 Structural Reliability**

This is the cornerstone performance requirement for all structures in Australia. A building must be designed and constructed to achieve a degree of structural reliability that ensures it will 5:

* Perform adequately under all reasonably expected design actions (e.g., the self-weight of the printed walls, loads from occupants and furniture).  
* Withstand extreme or frequently repeated design actions (e.g., high winds characteristic of Tasmania, potential seismic events).  
* Sustain local damage without leading to disproportionate collapse, a concept known as structural robustness.  
* Avoid causing damage to other properties.

The overarching objective is to safeguard people from injury caused by structural failure and to prevent the loss of amenity caused by structural behaviour.5 "Loss of amenity" is a broad term that includes issues short of collapse, such as excessive deflection or vibration that might cause doors to jam, windows to crack, or create discomfort for occupants.6

#### **1.2.2 B1P2 Structural Resistance**

This clause is the critical link between the structural reliability requirement and the need for a material testing program. It states that the structural resistance of materials and forms of construction must be determined using methodologies that account for material properties, fabrication processes, and modelling variability.5 For a conventional material like standard concrete blocks, this resistance is well-documented in Australian Standards. For a novel material like 3D printed concrete, this resistance is unknown and must be established through a comprehensive and defensible testing regime, as detailed in Part 4 of this report.

#### **1.2.3 Structural Actions and Loads (AS/NZS 1170\)**

The NCC mandates that structures be designed to withstand the most critical combination of loads and actions they may reasonably be subjected to.7 These actions are defined in the AS/NZS 1170 series of standards, which are primary referenced documents in the NCC.8 The key actions for the Cygnet project include:

* **Permanent Actions (Dead Loads) (AS/NZS 1170.1):** The self-weight of all permanent components, including the 3D printed walls, roof structure, floors, and internal finishes.7  
* **Imposed Actions (Live Loads) (AS/NZS 1170.1):** Loads resulting from the intended use and occupancy of the building, such as people, furniture, and movable equipment.7  
* **Wind Actions (AS/NZS 1170.2):** The design must account for wind forces based on the building's geographic location in Tasmania, its height, shape, and Importance Level.9 This is a critical design consideration for ensuring the building envelope's integrity.  
* **Earthquake Actions (AS 1170.4):** While Tasmania is an area of low seismicity, the requirements of AS 1170.4 must still be considered and addressed in the structural design.

The structural engineer must analyze all credible combinations of these loads to determine the most severe "action effects" (e.g., bending moments, shear forces) that the structure must resist.7

### **1.3 Fire Performance and Material Combustibility**

While this is a structural report, fire performance is intrinsically linked to material selection and structural design. The NCC classifies materials based on their combustibility, which in turn influences the fire-resistance requirements for structural elements.10

Based on the criteria in standards like ASTM E136, concrete is considered an inherently **noncombustible material**.10 This is a significant safety and compliance advantage for the 3DCP system. Most residential construction in Australia is classified as

**Type V Construction**.10 The structural engineer must ensure that the design of the 3DCP walls, including their thickness and the concrete cover provided to any internal reinforcement, meets the specific Fire Resistance Level (FRL) required by the NCC for that construction type and building class.

It is important to understand that the term "code compliant," as sometimes used by 3DCP technology providers 11, is often a simplification. A system is not inherently compliant. Compliance is achieved on a project-by-project basis through a rigorous engineering assessment that demonstrates the specific design, using the specific material, meets the Performance Requirements of the NCC. For instance, a claim that a system is compliant with AS/NZS 1170 11 only addresses one half of the equation—the loads the building must resist. The other, more challenging half is proving that the 3DCP system itself has the verified capacity to resist those loads, which is the central task of the Performance Solution.

## **Part 2: The Tasmanian Regulatory Environment**

This section localizes the national framework, detailing the specific Tasmanian legislation and administrative processes that create the legal pathway for the Cygnet project's approval.

### **2.1 The Building Act 2016: A Risk-Based Framework**

The *Building Act 2016* and the associated *Building Regulations 2016* are the primary legislative instruments that govern all building, plumbing, and demolition work in Tasmania.13 A key feature of this legislation is its modern, risk-based approach to approvals.15 The Act categorizes all work into one of three streams:

* **Low Risk Work:** Minor projects like fences or small decks that may not require a permit.15  
* **Medium Risk (Notifiable) Work:** Standard projects like a new detached house, which require certification from a building surveyor but not a full permit from the council.15  
* **High Risk (Permit) Work:** Complex projects, including commercial buildings, owner-builder work, or work requiring a planning permit.15

**The Cygnet project, being a new dwelling constructed with an innovative and uncodified building system, will unequivocally be classified as "High Risk (Permit Work)"**.15 This classification is not discretionary and triggers the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. It mandates that the project must obtain a formal

**Building Permit** from the relevant permit authority, which for the Cygnet site is the **Huon Valley Council**, before any work can commence.15

### **2.2 Key Roles and Responsibilities under the Act**

The Tasmanian framework establishes a clear separation of duties between technical certifiers and administrative authorities. Understanding these roles is crucial to navigating the process efficiently.

* **Specialist Building Surveyor:** This is the central technical figure in the approval of a Performance Solution. The building surveyor is a licensed professional responsible for assessing the proposed building work for compliance with the NCC.17 They hold the authority to issue the  
  **Certificate of Likely Compliance (CLC)**, which is the technical certification stating that the design, if built as specified, will comply with the code.15 For the Cygnet project, the early appointment of and collaboration with a building surveyor experienced in Performance Solutions is the single most important strategic step.  
* **Structural Engineer:** The engineer is a licensed building services provider responsible for the structural design, analysis, and specification of the 3DCP system.17 They must provide formal certification for their design, typically using the Director's approved  
  **Form 55: Certificate of Qualified Person – Assessable Item**, which attests that the design complies with the NCC and relevant standards.18  
* **Permit Authority (Huon Valley Council):** The council is the legal body that issues the final Building Permit.15 Its role in the structural approval is primarily administrative. It relies on the CLC issued by the independent building surveyor as the primary evidence of technical compliance. The council will not conduct its own structural assessment of the Performance Solution but will ensure that all procedural requirements of the  
  *Building Act 2016* have been met before issuing the permit.13  
* **Director of Building Control (CBOS):** The Director is the state-level regulator operating within Consumer, Building and Occupational Services (CBOS). The Director has the power to issue legally binding **Determinations** that clarify, specify, or modify how the Act and Regulations are to be applied in practice.14 These determinations are not optional guidelines; they have the force of law.

This structure creates a two-stage approval process for the Cygnet project. The first and most critical stage is achieving **Technical Certification** from the specialist building surveyor. The project's engineering effort must be focused on producing an evidence package so robust and compelling that the surveyor can confidently issue the CLC. The second stage is **Administrative Permitting** by the Huon Valley Council, which is contingent on the successful completion of the first stage.

### **2.3 Tasmanian Variations and Director's Determinations**

While Tasmania adopts the NCC, it does so with specific state-based variations and supplementary legal instruments that must be addressed.

* **NCC Variations:** The Tasmanian Government has, at times, chosen to defer the adoption of certain new provisions in the NCC. For example, it deferred the move to a 7-star energy efficiency rating and made specific amendments related to livable housing standards (Part H8).21 A key determination, Regulation 82A of the  
  *Building Amendment Regulations 2024*, provides a specific compliance pathway for these livable housing provisions.25 While these variations are important for the overall project design (architectural, services), they  
  **do not affect the core structural provisions in NCC Part B1**, which remain mandatory and unchanged for Tasmania.  
* **Director's Determinations:** These are of paramount importance. The project team must conduct a specific audit of all current Determinations published on the CBOS website to identify any that apply to the Cygnet project.27 Failure to comply with a relevant Determination is grounds for immediate rejection of an application. Key Determinations include:  
  * ***Director's Determination \- Categories of Building and Demolition Work:*** This instrument formally defines the criteria for Low, Medium, and High-risk work, confirming the Cygnet project's "High Risk" status.20  
  * ***Director's Determination \- Certificates by Qualified Persons for an Assessable Item:*** This specifies the required qualifications and expertise for persons (like the structural engineer) who provide certification for specific design elements (e.g., structural adequacy) using Form 55\.18  
  * ***Director's Determinations \- Building in Hazardous Areas:*** Tasmania has specific, non-negotiable requirements for building in designated hazardous areas. If the Cygnet site is mapped as being in a bushfire-prone, landslip, coastal inundation, or riverine inundation area, the relevant Determination will impose additional design constraints that must be incorporated into the structural design.19 Compliance with the Determination is taken to be compliance with the corresponding NCC provisions.29

## **Part 3: The Recommended Certification Pathway: A Performance Solution for 3DCP**

This section provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to developing the Performance Solution, which is the core technical task for the project's engineering and certification team.

### **3.1 Establishing the Mandate for a Performance Solution**

The NCC provides two fundamental pathways to demonstrate compliance with the mandatory Performance Requirements.2

1. A **Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Solution** is effectively a "recipe book" approach. It follows a set of prescriptive provisions detailed within the NCC and its referenced documents, such as Australian Standards.3 For example, AS 3600  
   *Concrete Structures* provides DTS provisions for designing conventional reinforced concrete elements. This pathway is suitable for standard construction methods and materials where performance is well-understood and codified. As 3DCP is a novel method not described in any DTS provision, this pathway is not available for the Cygnet project.  
2. A **Performance Solution** is the required alternative for any aspect of a design that does not follow a DTS recipe.3 It is a unique, first-principles approach tailored to the specific project. It involves demonstrating compliance with the Performance Requirements directly, through a process of rigorous analysis, testing, and evidence gathering.2 This is the only viable pathway for the structural certification of the 3DCP walls.

### **3.2 The Four-Step Performance Solution Process (ABCB Handbook)**

The Australian Building Codes Board (ABCB) publishes the *Performance Solution Process Handbook*, which outlines a formal, four-step process that must be followed and documented when developing a Performance Solution.32 The complexity of this process should be proportional to the complexity of the design.35

* **Step 1: Prepare a Performance-Based Design Brief (PBDB).** This is the foundational and most critical step in the entire process. The PBDB is a formal, documented agreement between all key project stakeholders, including the owner, architect, structural engineer, and most importantly, the **specialist building surveyor**.33 It must clearly define:  
  * The scope of the proposed Performance Solution (i.e., the 3DCP wall system).  
  * The applicable NCC Performance Requirements that must be met (e.g., B1P1, B1P2).  
  * The Assessment Methods that will be used to demonstrate compliance (see Section 3.3).  
  * The agreed-upon **Acceptance Criteria** that the final design must satisfy to be deemed compliant. This could include specific strength targets, deflection limits, or durability benchmarks.  
  * Getting stakeholder sign-off on the PBDB ensures there is a clear, agreed-upon roadmap before significant engineering work commences.33  
* **Step 2: Carry Out Analysis.** This step involves the detailed engineering work. The structural engineer will perform analysis, testing, modelling, and calculations to demonstrate that the proposed 3DCP design meets the Acceptance Criteria established in the PBDB.33 This will involve using the verified material properties derived from the testing program outlined in Part 4\.  
* **Step 3: Evaluate Results.** The outcomes of the analysis are systematically collated and evaluated against the Acceptance Criteria.33 The evaluation must conclude, with supporting evidence, that the Performance Solution will perform to a level that is equivalent to, or superior to, the level of safety and performance provided by the DTS Provisions it is replacing.3  
* **Step 4: Prepare a Final Report.** This is the comprehensive document that consolidates all previous steps and is submitted to the building surveyor for assessment. It serves as the primary justification for the issuance of a Certificate of Likely Compliance. The report must include the PBDB, a summary of the analysis undertaken, the evaluation of results against the acceptance criteria, and a clear conclusion that the design complies with the NCC, noting any assumptions or limitations.31

### **3.3 Leveraging the Four Assessment Methods**

To justify the Performance Solution, the final report must utilize one or more of the four Assessment Methods defined in the NCC.2 For the Cygnet project, a successful strategy will involve a combination of all four:

1. **Verification Method:** This involves using a test, calculation, or other quantifiable method to verify compliance.4 This will be the primary method used, underpinned by the extensive material and structural testing program detailed in Part 4\. Engineering calculations, such as finite element analysis (FEA) of the wall system, also fall under this method.31  
2. **Comparison with DTS Provisions:** This is a powerful comparative analysis where the performance of the 3DCP wall system is directly compared to that of a DTS-compliant alternative (e.g., a standard double-brick or blockwork wall).2 If it can be demonstrated that the 3DCP system is equivalent or superior under the same load conditions, it provides a strong argument for compliance.4  
3. **Evidence of Suitability:** This involves submitting documentary evidence to support performance claims.31 This is where third-party reports and precedents become invaluable. Key evidence for the Cygnet project will include:  
   * The **BRANZ Appraisal No. 1218** for the QOROX system.36  
   * NATA-accredited laboratory test reports for the project-specific concrete mix.37  
   * Published research papers on 3DCP from institutions like UNSW.39  
   * Technical literature from the 3DCP system supplier (e.g., Luyten, CyBe).41  
4. **Expert Judgement:** This is a formal, documented opinion from a person with the necessary qualifications and experience (e.g., the project's chartered structural engineer) to determine whether a solution complies with the Performance Requirements.2 This method is often used to support other methods or to bridge gaps where explicit test data is unavailable but performance can be reliably inferred from established engineering principles.

### **Table 1: Comparison of Compliance Pathways for the Cygnet Project**

| Feature | Deemed-to-Satisfy (DTS) Solution | Performance Solution | Applicability to Cygnet 3DCP Project |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Basis of Compliance** | Following a prescriptive "recipe" in the NCC or a referenced standard (e.g., AS 3600 for conventional concrete).3 | Meeting the mandatory Performance Requirements through a first-principles, evidence-based argument.2 | **Performance Solution is mandatory.** 3DCP is not a codified, prescriptive method, so no DTS "recipe" exists. |
| **Required Documentation** | Standard architectural and engineering drawings referencing DTS clauses and standards. | A comprehensive Performance Solution Report, including a PBDB, analysis, evaluation, and evidence.31 | Extensive documentation is required to justify the novel system to the Building Surveyor. |
| **Role of Innovation** | Limited. The pathway is designed for standard, established construction methods.3 | Encouraged. The pathway is specifically designed to accommodate new materials, technologies, and innovative designs.2 | The Performance Solution is the designated NCC pathway for enabling the project's core innovation. |
| **Burden of Proof** | Low. Compliance is "deemed" if the recipe is followed correctly. | High. The project team bears the full responsibility for proving compliance to the satisfaction of the Building Surveyor.3 | The project must fund and manage a rigorous testing and analysis program to meet this burden of proof. |
| **Key Professional** | Builder/Designer following the code. | Specialist Engineer and Building Surveyor collaborating on the evidence-based design.33 | Early engagement and collaboration with a specialist Building Surveyor is critical to success. |

## **Part 4: Material Verification and Structural Substantiation**

This section details the specific engineering tests and standards required to generate the "Evidence of Suitability" and "Verification Method" data needed for the Performance Solution. This testing program forms the scientific backbone of the entire compliance argument.

### **4.1 Defining the Performance of 3D Printed Concrete**

The core technical challenge of 3DCP is that the printing process creates a material that is **anisotropic**, meaning its structural properties can vary depending on the direction of the applied load relative to the printed layers. The interface between layers is a potential plane of weakness. Therefore, the testing regime must be more comprehensive than for conventional (isotropic) concrete and must be designed to quantify this directional behaviour.

* **Key Fresh-State Properties:** While not directly used in the final structural calculations, verifying the properties of the concrete mix in its fresh state is critical for quality control and ensuring that the intended hardened properties are consistently achieved on site. These include 39:  
  * **Extrudability:** The ability of the material to be reliably pumped and extruded through the nozzle.  
  * **Buildability:** The capacity of the freshly deposited layers to hold their shape and support the weight of subsequent layers without collapse.  
  * Open Time: The time window during which the mix remains sufficiently workable to be printed.  
    New standards, such as ASTM WK94968, are being developed to create reproducible test methods for these "printability" parameters.43  
* **Key Hardened-State Properties for Structural Design:** The following properties of the hardened concrete must be quantified through physical testing:  
  * **Compressive Strength:** This is the primary measure of concrete quality and performance. For 3DCP, it is essential to test samples cored from a printed element in three orientations: parallel to the print layers, perpendicular to the print layers, and at a 45-degree angle to assess combined shear and compression behaviour.44  
  * **Tensile & Flexural Strength:** These properties are critical for assessing the material's resistance to cracking under bending loads.44 The splitting tensile strength test (ASTM C496) is a common method.  
  * **Inter-layer Bond Strength:** This is arguably the most critical property unique to 3DCP. It quantifies the adhesion between printed layers and determines the material's resistance to delamination, which is a failure mode not present in monolithic concrete. Test methods adapted from masonry bond strength tests (e.g., ASTM E518) can be used to measure this property.44  
  * **Durability Properties:** To demonstrate a 50-year design life, tests for drying shrinkage (as per AS 1012.13), water permeability, and potentially freeze-thaw resistance (ASTM C666) are essential.44

### **4.2 A Framework for Material Testing (Adapting Existing Standards)**

In the absence of a dedicated Australian Standard for 3DCP materials 47, a robust and defensible testing plan must be developed by adapting established standards for conventional concrete and masonry. This plan must be documented in the PBDB and agreed upon with the building surveyor before testing commences.

* **Primary Australian Standards for Adaptation:**  
  * **AS 3600 *Concrete Structures*:** This standard provides the benchmark requirements that the material must ultimately meet. It defines the minimum characteristic compressive strengths (fc′​) required for different durability exposure classifications and provides the design principles for reinforced concrete.48  
  * **AS 1012 *Methods of testing concrete*:** This series of standards provides the prescriptive procedures for conducting the tests. For example, AS 1012.9 specifies how to perform a compressive strength test, and AS 1012.3.1 specifies the slump test for workability.45 These procedures will need to be adapted for samples cored from printed elements.  
* **International Standards for Guidance:** The ASTM International standards committee is more advanced in developing specific tests for additively manufactured concrete. Referencing relevant ASTM standards (e.g., ASTM C39, C496, C666) will add significant weight and credibility to the testing plan.43  
* **Sampling Protocol:** A critical point for agreement with the building surveyor is the sampling protocol. It is recommended that samples be both **cored from purpose-built test walls** (to measure the true, in-situ, anisotropic properties) and **cast into traditional cylinder moulds** (to provide a baseline, isotropic comparison and for quality control). While technology providers like Luyten have reported exceptional compressive strength results of up to 82.5 MPa for their proprietary mix 38, these results must be independently verified by a NATA-accredited laboratory for the specific material batch and printing process used on the Cygnet project.

### **4.3 Durability Design per AS 3600**

A non-negotiable aspect of the design is ensuring durability for a minimum 50-year design life.46 The structural engineer must:

1. Determine the specific **Exposure Classification** for the Cygnet project site according to Table 4.3 of AS 3600:2009. This classification (e.g., A1, A2, B1, B2, C1) is based on the surrounding environment, such as proximity to the coast, industrial pollution, and soil conditions.46  
2. Design the concrete mix to achieve the **minimum characteristic compressive strength (fc′​)** mandated by AS 3600 for that exposure classification.46  
3. Specify the **minimum concrete cover** to any steel reinforcement within the printed walls. This cover is a critical barrier that protects the steel from moisture and chlorides, preventing corrosion and ensuring the structure's long-term integrity.50

These durability requirements are essentially a DTS component within the broader Performance Solution and must be strictly adhered to.

### **Table 3: Material Properties Verification & Testing Plan**

| Property | Test Method (Standard) | Sampling Protocol | Test Frequency (Minimum) | Proposed Acceptance Criteria (Example) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Fresh Concrete** |  |  |  |  |
| Workability (Slump) | AS 1012.3.1 | From mixer before each print run | Per batch of concrete mixed | Value to be within supplier's specified range |
| **Hardened Concrete** |  |  |  |  |
| Compressive Strength (Perpendicular to layers) | AS 1012.9 (adapted for cored samples) | 3 x 100mm dia. cores from test wall at 28 days | Per 20 m³ of printed material or per print day | Characteristic strength (fc′​) ≥ 40 MPa (or as required by durability design) |
| Compressive Strength (Parallel to layers) | AS 1012.9 (adapted for cored samples) | 3 x 100mm dia. cores from test wall at 28 days | Per 20 m³ of printed material or per print day | Result to inform anisotropic material model for FEA |
| Splitting Tensile Strength | AS 1012.10 / ASTM C496 | 3 x 100mm dia. cores from test wall at 28 days | Per 20 m³ of printed material or per print day | Result to inform structural analysis for crack control |
| Inter-layer Bond Strength | ASTM E518 (adapted) or similar flexural bond test | 3 x beam samples cut from test wall at 28 days | Per 20 m³ of printed material or per print day | Bond strength ≥ 1.5 MPa (to be confirmed in PBDB) |
| Drying Shrinkage | AS 1012.13 | Cast prism samples from production mix | One set of tests per project | Shrinkage strain \< 800 microstrain at 56 days |
| Modulus of Elasticity | AS 1012.17 / ASTM C469 | Cored or cast cylinder samples at 28 days | One set of tests per project | Result to be used as a key input for structural deflection analysis |

## **Part 5: Precedent Analysis: Pathways to Approval in Australasia**

This section uses real-world examples from Australia and New Zealand to provide evidence and build confidence in the proposed compliance strategy. These precedents are not a substitute for the project's own evidence but serve as powerful tools for demonstrating industry acceptance and establishing benchmarks.

### **5.1 New Zealand Gold Standard: The QOROX BRANZ Appraisal (No. 1218\)**

The most significant and directly relevant precedent for the Cygnet project is the appraisal of the QOROX 3D Printed Concrete Wall System by BRANZ in New Zealand.51 BRANZ is a highly respected, independent product testing and appraisal authority, and its findings carry significant weight with regulators in both New Zealand and Australia.

* **Scope and Key Findings:** The appraisal (No. 1218, issued June 2022\) assesses the QOROX system for use as internal and external structural walls.36 It concludes that, when designed and installed correctly, the system meets the performance requirements of the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) for Structure (Clause B1) and Durability (Clause B2), which are directly analogous to the NCC's requirements.36 The appraisal is based on a specified design compressive strength of 30 MPa and notes that the system has been tested for seismic and fire performance under New Zealand conditions.36  
* **Conditions and Limitations:** The appraisal is not a blanket approval. It is contingent on several critical conditions: the walls must be subject to specific engineering design by a qualified engineer, and exposed external surfaces **must be coated with a weatherproof coating** to prevent moisture and carbon dioxide ingress, thereby ensuring the required 50-year durability.36 The appraisal does not cover other parts of the building like foundations or roofs.36  
* **Value to the Cygnet Project:** The BRANZ appraisal is the project's most powerful piece of "Evidence of Suitability." It provides a complete template for the *type, scope, and level of detail* of the evidence package that the Tasmanian building surveyor will expect to see. It demonstrates that a rigorous, third-party, evidence-based assessment of a 3DCP wall system is the most effective way to satisfy a regulator. The project's final Performance Solution Report should be structured to mirror the content of the BRANZ appraisal, addressing structure, durability, fire, and other relevant code aspects, and should explicitly reference the appraisal as a key supporting document. This significantly de-risks the certification process for the building surveyor, as it shows that a similar system has already undergone extensive scrutiny and been found compliant with a very similar building code.

### **5.2 Australian Case Studies: Luyten and Contour 3D**

Several projects within Australia provide further evidence of the technology's viability and growing acceptance.

* **Luyten:** This Melbourne-based company has been a prominent pioneer, completing multiple projects including their "Heptapod" code-compliant test house and Australia's first multi-story 3D printed building.11 They claim their proprietary "Ultimatecrete" mix is NATA-certified and can achieve compressive strengths up to 82.5 MPa.37 Their ongoing collaboration with the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is aimed at developing data to inform future technical standards, which implicitly acknowledges the current gap in codified provisions.40  
* **Contour 3D:** This company was involved in a social housing project in Dubbo, NSW, demonstrating the technology's potential for delivering affordable housing rapidly.57  
* **Value to the Cygnet Project:** These Australian projects serve as important examples of "Evidence of Suitability." The NATA certification for Luyten's material provides a strong data point, but it is a certification of a material property under specific test conditions, not a full system appraisal like the BRANZ document. These case studies are valuable for demonstrating that similar structures have been successfully built and for providing insights into construction logistics and achievable architectural forms. However, the claims made by these companies regarding material strength and code compliance must be treated as inputs for the Cygnet project's own independent verification process, not as final proof. The project must commission its own NATA-accredited testing on its specific material mix and print process to generate its own primary evidence.

### **5.3 International Context (UK)**

The experience in the United Kingdom mirrors the challenges in Australia. The lack of specific rules and regulations for 3DCP creates legal grey areas and a reluctance for mainstream adoption by construction companies.59 Projects are proceeding, but on a case-by-case basis, relying on bespoke approvals.61 This international context reinforces the necessity of the project-specific, first-principles Performance Solution approach outlined in this report. It confirms that a mature, off-the-shelf regulatory framework cannot be relied upon, and the burden of proof rests squarely with the project proponent.

## **Part 6: The Cygnet Project Compliance Action Plan**

This final section translates the preceding research and analysis into a practical, step-by-step plan with actionable checklists for the project team to execute.

### **6.1 Engineering & Certification Process Map**

The following flowchart outlines the end-to-end process for achieving regulatory approval for the Cygnet project.

1. **Phase 1: Team & Strategy Formulation**  
   * **Action:** Appoint a specialist Building Surveyor with demonstrated experience in Performance Solutions.  
   * **Action:** Appoint a qualified Structural Engineer (Chartered, NER registered) with experience in innovative materials.  
   * **Action:** Convene a project inception meeting with the owner, architect, surveyor, and engineer.  
2. **Phase 2: Performance-Based Design & Verification**  
   * **Action:** Collaboratively develop the **Performance-Based Design Brief (PBDB)**. This is the key milestone.  
   * **Action:** Secure formal sign-off on the PBDB from the Building Surveyor and Structural Engineer.  
   * **Action:** Commission a NATA-accredited laboratory to execute the Material Testing Plan (as per Table 3).  
   * **Action:** Engineer conducts structural design and analysis using the verified material properties from the testing program.  
3. **Phase 3: Technical Certification**  
   * **Action:** Engineer prepares the comprehensive **Final Performance Solution Report**, consolidating the PBDB, analysis, test results, and evaluation.  
   * **Action:** Engineer signs and issues **Form 55: Certificate of Qualified Person** for the structural design.  
   * **Action:** Submit the full evidence package to the Building Surveyor.  
   * **Milestone:** Building Surveyor assesses the submission and, if satisfied, issues the **Certificate of Likely Compliance (CLC) (Form 11A)**.  
4. **Phase 4: Council Permitting & Construction**  
   * **Action:** Compile the full Building Permit application package (see checklist in Table 4).  
   * **Action:** Lodge **Form 2: Application for Building Permit** with the Huon Valley Council.  
   * **Milestone:** Huon Valley Council issues the Building Permit.  
   * **Action:** Commence construction, adhering to mandatory notification stages for inspections as required by the Building Surveyor.19  
5. **Phase 5: Completion & Occupancy**  
   * **Action:** Building Surveyor conducts final inspections.  
   * **Action:** Apply for an **Occupancy Permit** from the council.16  
   * **Milestone:** Project completion and handover.

### **6.2 Documentation Submission Checklist (Huon Valley Council)**

For a "High Risk (Permit Work)" application, a complete package of documentation must be submitted to the Huon Valley Council. The following checklist, detailed further in Table 4, outlines the required items.

* **Core Application Forms:**  
  * Application for Building Permit (CBOS Form 2).16  
* **Technical Certifications (from Professionals):**  
  * Certificate of Likely Compliance (CLC) issued by the Building Surveyor (CBOS Form 11A).62  
  * Certificate of Qualified Person – Structural Design, signed by the Structural Engineer (CBOS Form 55).18  
* **Supporting Reports and Plans:**  
  * The Final Performance Solution Report (prepared by the Engineer).  
  * Full set of architectural drawings (site plan, floor plans, elevations, sections).  
  * Full set of structural engineering drawings (foundation plan, wall reinforcement details, roof framing).  
  * Geotechnical (soil test) report for the site.28  
  * Energy efficiency assessment report.  
  * Any required reports for building in hazardous areas (e.g., Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) assessment).  
* **Third-Party Approvals and Levies:**  
  * Certificate of the Responsible Designer, including evidence of TasWater approval (CBOS Form 35).28  
  * Evidence of payment of all relevant building and training levies.

### **6.3 Practitioner Engagement and Verification**

Under the *Occupational Licensing Act 2005*, key professionals involved in the building process must be licensed in Tasmania.17 It is a mandatory due diligence step for the project proponent to verify the license status and scope of practice for all appointed practitioners. This can be done via the public search portal on the CBOS website: "Find a licensed tradesperson".17 The project must ensure that the appointed Building Surveyor and Structural Engineer hold current, valid licenses with the appropriate scope to cover a project of this nature.

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

The regulatory and engineering pathway for the approval of the 3DCP Cygnet project in Tasmania is complex but clearly defined. It is a journey that requires a shift from conventional compliance thinking to a rigorous, evidence-based approach. The National Construction Code, through its performance-based structure, explicitly provides the framework for such innovation. The Tasmanian *Building Act 2016* localizes this framework, establishing a risk-based process that designates the project as "High Risk" and places the specialist Building Surveyor in the pivotal role of technical certifier.

Success is not guaranteed by the novelty of the technology but must be earned through a meticulous and proactive strategy. The following recommendations are critical:

1. **Prioritize the Performance Solution Pathway:** The project team must immediately discard any notion of a Deemed-to-Satisfy approach and focus all resources on developing a robust Performance Solution. This is the only viable path to compliance.  
2. **Appoint and Collaborate with Experts Early:** The immediate appointment of a specialist Building Surveyor and a qualified Structural Engineer, both with experience in Performance Solutions, is the most critical next step. Their early involvement in shaping the Performance-Based Design Brief (PBDB) will prevent rework and align the engineering effort with the certifier's expectations from day one.  
3. **Commit to a Comprehensive Testing Program:** The project must budget for and execute a comprehensive material testing program through a NATA-accredited laboratory. The properties of the 3D printed concrete must be verified independently for the project-specific mix and process. This data is the non-negotiable foundation of the entire structural verification.  
4. **Leverage Precedent as a Template:** The BRANZ Appraisal No. 1218 for the QOROX system should be adopted as the "gold standard" template for the project's own evidence package. Structuring the final Performance Solution Report to mirror the scope and rigor of the BRANZ appraisal will provide the Building Surveyor with a high level of confidence and a familiar assessment framework.

By embracing this structured, evidence-based strategy, the Cygnet project can confidently navigate the regulatory landscape, mitigate the risks associated with innovative construction, and establish a landmark precedent for the future of 3D concrete printing in Tasmania.
